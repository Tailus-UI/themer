# Tailus Themer

Tailwind CSS Styling Library for Building Modern, Consistent and Accessible Web UIs with Radix UI, Melt UI, and Radix Vue.

## Concept

Imagine Tailus Themer as a secret style vault for our UI Kits. It uses Tailwind CSS, making it super easy to customize the look and feel of your components. This means you get a consistent design foundation across all these UI Kits, but with the freedom to tweak things to perfectly match your brand.

## Features

-   üé® Built-in Palettes
-   üé® Multi-Theming
-   üõ†Ô∏è Effortless Customization
-   üöÄ Expanded Component Variants
-   ‚ôø Accessibility First
-   üåü Modern & Trendy

## Quick Start

1. **Install Tailus Themer:**

```bash
npm install @tailus/themer
```

2. **Update your tailwindcss config**

    Import the themer preset to set default theme and enable data-attributes customizations

```javascript
import type { Config } from 'tailwindcss'
import { themer, grayColorVariables } from '@tailus/themer'

module.exports =  {
  content: [
    // your other paths
    "./node_modules/@tailus/themer/dist/**/*.{js,ts}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        gray: grayColorVariables,
      },
    },
  },
  presets: [
    themer
  ]
} satisfies Config
```

Under normal circumstances, it's not necessary to add the `gray` color to your Tailwind CSS configuration. However, because Tailwind CSS generates the `gray` color from the `defaultTheme` object, you must include it in your configuration to prevent any errors.

## Customize your theme

Use `data-attributes` to customize your theme

### Palette

Use the `data-palette` attribute to change the color palette of your theme.
